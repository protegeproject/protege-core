/*
 * There is a temptation to define Protege using a generic here.  But this
 * creates a problem.  If we define a class Foo extending Protege<String>
 * then the class Foo will include a defintion of 
 *      String execute();
 * Unfortunately code expecting a Protege object will need a definition of 
 *      Object execute()
 * and will not find it.  This can lead to AbstractMethodError even when the 
 * sources are in sync and everything compiles (on at least some jvm).  It is possible
 * that the jvm generating the exception and the jvm that compiled the code
 * have different treatment of this situation. 
 * 
 * There may be a good solution to this problem (generic method declarations) but 
 * there are several places where this can go wrong (e.g. the rmi implementation?)
 * so I have decided not to mess with it.
 * 
 * This problem is jvm specific.  On the OS X jvm, there appears to be no
 * problem but on other jvm's there is.  From my reading of the generics 
 * documentation, this should not happen.  This case is explicitly  considered
 * and a solution is explained.  Is this related to RMI and is it a java bug?
 * 
 * Still under investigation...

 * Protege server.  If the jvm is executing the knowledge base locally, 
 * this unit of work is executed directly on the local knowledge base.
