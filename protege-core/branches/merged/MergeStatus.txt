Merged With Trunk:          1776  To install temporary fix which includes 
                                  frames from included projects in the 
                                  database.
Merged With Trunk Revision: 2010  To synchronize some updates to the

Starting the merge process:

    Copy the latest branches/nci_june15 to branches/merged - revision 5933

    Check the merged branch out.

    The nci_june15 branch was merged to trunk@2010 so this is where I will
    start the diffs

    svn merge $p/trunk@2010 $p/trunk@5933 .
       (p=http://smi-protege/repos/protege/protege-core).


    Put the nci_june15 version of the server tree back in place of the
    conflicted  stuff in the working repository.

       rm -rf src/edu/stanford/smi/protege/server
       svn update  src/edu/stanford/smi/protege/server
       svn diff -r 2010:5933 $p/trunk/src/edu/stanford/smi/protege/server \
                   > ~/Shared/Journal/diff-server.txt    
                   
There was no other svn activity during this process.
