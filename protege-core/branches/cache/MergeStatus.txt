---------------------------------------------------------
Diffs are actually pretty minimal:
  1. the server.update package is all different (one conflict)
  2. diffs to 
      src/edu/stanford/smi/protege/server/framestore/background/FrameCalculator.java
      src/edu/stanford/smi/protege/server/framestore/RemoteClientFrameStore.java
      src/edu/stanford/smi/protege/server/framestore/Registration.java
      src/edu/stanford/smi/protege/server/framestore/ServerFrameStore.java
  Steps to merge to trunk
      p=http://smi-protege/repos/protege/protege-core
      svn merge $p/trunk $p/branches/cache
  but then be careful about commits...
