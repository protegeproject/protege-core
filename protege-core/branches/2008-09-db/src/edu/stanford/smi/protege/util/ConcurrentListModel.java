/*
 * Tim's rule of comments: big comments mean trouble.
 * 
 * Be careful of deadlock.  Actually I am not sure this is a problem but it made me nervous so I was careful.  
 * The approach that I took is to synchronize the inner list and the read methods. If there is only one writer
 * then I don't have to worry about things changing underneath the writer.  The fact that the list is 
 * synchronized means that readers are safe accessing the list.
 * 
 * The world could change underneath the reader while he is trying to find something. But synchronizing 
 * the reader methods protect the reader from change.  These methods are safe to synchronize because they
 * do not make calls such as fire... which might take who knows what locks.
 * 
 * I don't need to synchronize all the reader calls but it seems safer since there is little or no performance
 * penalty.
