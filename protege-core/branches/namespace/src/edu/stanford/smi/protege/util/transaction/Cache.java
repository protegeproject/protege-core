/**
 * This interface represents a simple cache mechanism for storing cached  
 * values either globally or on a per session basis.  This cache mechanism is 
 * caching the values (of type R) of a variable (of type V).
 *
 * There are three issues that make the interpretation of this interface rather
 * complex.  The first issue is the easier one.  When we do a cache lookup and 
 * get a non-null value, it is clear that the cache has the result that we want
 * to use.  But in some occasions it is important to also know that the cache is
 * complete in the sense that if we get a null value it is also the right answer.
 * To handle this we have created an interval between Cache.startCompleteCache
 * and Cache.finishCompleteCache were all entries added form a complete list of 
 * possible values in the cache.  We allow for the possibility that values will  be
 * invalidated between Cache.startCompleteCache and Cache.finishCompleteCache and even
 * that they will be invalidated after and in that case we keep track of which items
 * may be incomplete and which items are not.
 * 
 * The second issue is a bruiser!  Transactions!! Oh man!!! This adds a lot of complexity.
 * This means that different sessions might see different values.  A session in a transaction
 * may see values that are not visible to other sessions.  In addition, the behavior depends
 * on the transaction isolation level.  If the level is Read committed  or higher, changes made
 * by a session in a transaction are not visible to other sessions until the transaction is 
 * committed.  This means that we need to distinguish between values read and values written and 
 * we need to keep track of who is doing the read or write.  If the level is repeatable read or 
 * higher then the cache must not return a value for read even if the right value is known because
 * the underlying mechanism needs to be informed of the read.
 * 
 * The third issue is that we want it to be possible to garbage collect.  This  could be inconsistent with 
 * the need to have a complete cache.
